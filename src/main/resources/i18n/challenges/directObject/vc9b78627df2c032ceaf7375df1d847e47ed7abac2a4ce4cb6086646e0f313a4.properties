challenge.description = <p>One solution to avoid IDOR vulnerabilities is to use an unpredictable ID for every sensitive parameter that you are using inside your app such as <i>userid</i>. </p><p>So an &#34;unpredictable ID&#34; is anything used as an ID that isn&#39;t able to be predicted. It&#39;s most often a UUID, such as 0e925156-1dce-11ed-861d-0242ac120002. But it could also be a concatenation of a random value and a unix timestamp or any other number of things.</p><p>When you use a weak encryption algorithm such as md5, base64, etc. the ID becomes predictable.</p><p>Lessons:<p><ol><li>Don&#39;t use weak encryption algorithm which are easy to crack.</li><li>Just because an ID is unpredictable, that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be found. Here&#39;s the many ways in which unpredictable IDs can be found.<ul><li><b>Wayback machine:</b>Archives urls and pages. Unpredictable IDs are often in the parameters or in url path.</li><li><b>Common Crawl:</b>Archives urls and pages. Unpredictable IDs are often in the parameters or in url path.</li><li><b>Google search:</b>Google indexes links which might have IDs in the path or parameters, caches pages which might have IDs on them, and indexes websites (like forums) where people often post urls or full requests which include IDs</li><li><b>Github search:</b>Github public repos often include users posting their requests for debugging purposes in the Issues section, hardcoding unpredictable IDs into scripts, etc</li><li><b>Insider threat - previous employee:</b>A previous employee who used the application on their personal laptop can look at the logs or local storage of their PC to get the IDs or they could have simply write them down before quitting or after getting fired but before <b>access revocation</b>.</li><li><b>Referer header</b>Referer headers with the ID in the path or GET parameters would leak the ID to other servers</li></ul</li></ol>
